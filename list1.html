                    <ul>
                        <li>Washington is the 18th-largest state, with an area of 71,362 square miles (184,830 km2), 
                             and the 13th-most populous state, with more than 7.7 million people.[6] The majority of 
                             Washington's residents live in the Seattle metropolitan area, the center of transportation, 
                             business, and industry on Puget Sound,[7][8] an inlet of the Pacific Ocean consisting of numerous 
                             islands, deep fjords, and bays carved out by glaciers. </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The Greater Los Angeles area and the San Francisco Bay Area are the nation's second and fifth most 
                             populous urban regions respectively, with the former having more than 18.7 million residents and the 
                             latter having over 9.6 million.[13] Sacramento is the state's capital, while Los Angeles is the most 
                             populous city in the state and the second most populous city in the country (after New York City).</li>

                <li>Arizona</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Arizona is the 48th state and last of the contiguous states to be admitted to the Union, achieving statehood 
                             on February 14, 1912. Historically part of the territory of Alta California in New Spain, it became part of 
                             independent Mexico in 1821. After being defeated in the Mexicanâ€“American War, Mexico ceded much of this territory 
                             to the United States in 1848.</li>

                     <ul>
                        <li>Utah has been inhabited for thousands of years by various indigenous groups such as the ancient Puebloans, Navajo 
                             and Ute. The Spanish were the first Europeans to arrive in the mid-16th century, though the region's difficult 
                             geography and harsh climate made it a peripheral part of New Spain and later Mexico.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Oregon has been home to many indigenous nations for thousands of years.[citation needed] The first European traders, 
                              explorers, and settlers began exploring what is now Oregon's Pacific coast in the early-mid 16th century. As early as 
                              1564, the Spanish began sending vessels northeast from the Philippines, riding the Kuroshio Current in a sweeping circular 
                              route across the northern part of the Pacific</li>
